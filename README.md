# Drought Monitoring in Agriculture Using Remote Sensing (RS) and GIS

**Overview**
This project focuses on monitoring agricultural drought in Gujarat using remote sensing (RS) and GIS technologies. We aimed to create drought monitoring maps for the Kharif season (July to October) from 2012 to 2016. The study examined the impact of drought on crop productivity across districts of Gujarat.

**Objectives:**
Create drought monitoring maps using Google Earth Engine (GEE).
Analyze the relationship between drought conditions and crop productivity.


**Data Sources:**
Remote Sensing Data:

MODIS LST (Land Surface Temperature)
MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
CHIRPS Rainfall Data

Agricultural Data:
Area, Yield, and Production data from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government of India

**Methodology:**

Data Processing:
Extract, rescale, and reclassify key indicators: NDVI, LST, and rainfall.

**Indices Computed:**
Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)
Temperature Condition Index (TCI)
Precipitation Condition Index (PCI)

In**tegration & Mapping:**
Apply Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP).
Weightage overlay of the computed indices.
Generate the Composite Drought Index (CDI).

**Key Findings:**
The Composite Drought Index (CDI) remained stable with slight fluctuations from 2012 to 2016.
Despite mild drought conditions, productivity trends improved, likely due to better agricultural practices and water management strategies.
The notable dip in productivity during 2013 suggests other external factors may have influenced crop yields.

**Conclusion:**
Our analysis highlights the resilience and adaptability of Gujarat's agricultural sector despite periodic drought conditions. This study emphasizes the power of remote sensing and GIS in agricultural drought monitoring and management.
